### 🟢 About Me
I am a **Cloud Infra. Engineer** with a core in **Data Analytics & Engineering** where I have architected Data Warehouses, orchestrated ETL Pipelines, and developed Dynamic Dashboards. 

With expertise in Software Development and **4+ successful deployments** (including a gov. entity), I am currently scaling my knowledge base horizontally in **Cloud & DevOps Methodologies**.

As an **IAM Analyst at Cognizant**, I manage user identities and access rights for a dedicated client environment. My work involves provisioning/de‑provisioning, enforcing security policies through **GPOs**, and ensuring compliance using **Salesforce**.
